# **JavaScript-Timed-Quiz**
This repo is for week 3 challenge for the timed javascript quiz.

<br/>

### ***Purpose***
The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate my understanding of javascript as well as a strong understanding of variables, arrays, objects and functions.

<br/>

### ***Goal***
The goal of this challenge is to display my understanding of javascript; specifically functions, variables, objects, arrays as well as how to manipulate these items.

<br/>

### ***Challenges***
The most challenging part of the project was figuring out how to save to local storage for the highscores and then display those scores.

With office hours and tutor support I still found this concept a bit confusing, 
**BUT** I was able to console log my score but was not sure how to display that after the quiz is over. 

Another challenging aspect of this project was how to approach a question/answer box for the quiz, but not as confusing as the local storage feature. 

I also found a bug that forces the user to press the final correct answer twice before the quiz is over and I was not sure how to de-bug this before the due date.
